This Sudoko game is a project written in Python. This project implements Python GUI, Object-Oriented Programming principles, and backtracking.

## Python
As this project is written in Python, I have chosen Pygame to enable user interaction.

## Object-Oriented Programming
This project uses multiple principles of Object-Oriented Programming to help simplify the code, including abstrsaction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Backtracking
The solve method of this project utilized a backtracking algorithm to recursively test for correct choices for each available spot.
